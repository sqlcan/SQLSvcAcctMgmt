# SQLSvcAcctMgmt
Change SQL Server Service Account Password using PowerShell

The PowerShell script uses SQL Server SMO and Win32_Service class to update the password for one or more servers.  I have tested the script against SQL Server 2016 on Windows 2016; please test the script for yourself before executing on production.
